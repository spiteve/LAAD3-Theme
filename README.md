# LAAD3

This is a CSS style designed for LAAD3 (Longman Advanced American Dictionary), with both **dark** and **light** mode.

The colour scheme is inspired by [Gruvbox colour palette](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox.git).

# Deployment

Simply place the `img` folder and `css` file into the root of dictionary (usually the same level as the `mdx` file).

- If the style has not changed, try clearing the cache of dictionary software and restarting it. 
- Please do not change the file name, this will also invalidate the configuration.
